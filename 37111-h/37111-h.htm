<h2>A Trip to Fable Land</h2>


<p>"Well," said the Zankiwank as he swallowed
another jam tart, "I think we had
better start on our travels at once."</p>

<p>They were all standing under the clock at
Charing Cross Station when the station was
closed and everybody else had departed, except
the train which the Zankiwank had himself chartered.
It was all so odd and strange, and the
gathering was so very motley, that if it had been
to-morrow morning instead of last night, Willie
and Maude would certainly have said they had
both been dreaming. But, of course, they were
not dreaming because they were wide-awake
and dressed. Besides, they remembered Charing
Cross Station quite well, having started therefrom
with their father and mother only last
summer when they went to the sea-side for
their holidays&mdash;and what jolly times they had
on the sands! So Maude said promptly, "It
is not Night-mare or Dreams or Anything.
We don't know what it is, but we must not
go to sleep, Willie, in case anything should
happen."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 160px;">
<a name="Page5" id="Page5"></a>
<img src="images/z018.jpg" width="160" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Willie replied that he did not want to go to
sleep any more. "I believe it's a show," he added,
"and somebody's run away with us. How lovely!
I'm glad we are lost. Let us go and ask that
tall gentleman, who looks like the parlour-tongs
in a bathing-suit, to give us some more
buns." For, being a boy, he could always eat
buns, or an abundance of them, only I hope
you won't tell the nursery governess I told
you.</p>

<p>It was the Zankiwank, who was doing some
conjuring tricks for the benefit of the Jackarandajam
and Mr Swinglebinks, to whom Willie
referred. The Zankiwank was certainly a very
curious person to look at. He had very long
legs, very long arms, and a very small body, a
long neck and a head like a peacock.
He was not wearing a
bathing suit as Willie imagined,
because there were tails to his
jacket, hanging down almost to
his heels. He wore a sash round
his waist, and his clothes were all
speckled as though he had been
peppered with the colours out of
a very large kaleidoscope. The
Jackarandajam was also rather tall
and thin, but dressed in the very
height of fashion, with a flower in
his coat and a cigarette in his
mouth, which he never smoked
because he never lit it. He was
believed by all the others&mdash;you
shall know who all the others
were presently&mdash;to know more
things than the Man-in-the-Moon,
because he nearly always said
something that nobody else ever
thought of. And the Man-in-the-Moon knows
more things than the Old Woman of Mars. You
have naturally heard all about Mars&mdash;at least, if
you have not heard all about her, you all have
heard about her, which is just the same thing,
only reversed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was an Old Woman of Mars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who'd constantly say "Bless my stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There's the Sun and the Moon<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the Earth in a swoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All dying for par-tic-u-lars-u-lars!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this planet of mine called Mars!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Mr Swinglebinks, unlike his two companions,
was short, stout, and dreadfully important. In
Fable Land, where we are going as soon as we
start for that happy place, he kept a grocer's
shop once upon a time. As nobody cared a fig
for his sugar and currants, however, he retired
from business and took to dates and the making
of new almanacks, and was now travelling about
for the benefit of his figures. He was very strong
on arithmetic, and could read, write, and arith-metise
before he went to school, so he never went
at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Page7" id="Page7"></a>
<img src="images/z020.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>While the Zankiwank was talking to his friends
an unseen porter rang an unseen bell, and called
out in an unknown tongue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Take your seats for Fableland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which stands upon a Tableland,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And don't distress the guard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when you pass the Cableland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say nothing to the Gableland<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because it hurts the guard."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"We must put that porter back in the bottle,"
said the Jackarandajam, "we shall want some
bottled porter to drink on the road."</p>

<p>"Well," said Maude, "what a ridiculous thing
to say. We don't bottle railway porters, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"I wish the Bletherwitch would come," exclaimed
the Zankiwank, "we shall miss the next
train. She is most provoking. She promised to
be here three weeks ago, and we have been
waiting ever since."</p>

<p>This astounding statement quite disturbed
Willie, who almost swallowed a bun in his excitement.
Had he and Maude been waiting there
three weeks as well? What would they think at
home? You see Maude and Willie, who were
brother and sister, had been on a visit to their
grandmama; and on their way home they had
fallen asleep in the carriage, after having repeated
to each other all the wonderful fairy tales their
grandmama had related to them. How long
they had slept they could not guess, but when
they woke up, instead of finding themselves at
home in St George's Square, they discovered that
they were at Charing Cross Station. Mary, their
nurse, had disappeared, so had John the coachman,
and it was the Zankiwank who had opened the
door and assisted them to alight, saying at the
same time most politely&mdash;</p>

<p>"I assist you to alight, because it is so dark."</p>

<p>Then he gave them buns and chocolates, icecreams,
apples, pears, shrimps and cranberry
tarts. So it stands to reason that after such a
mixture they were rather perplexed. However,
they did not seem very much distressed, and as
they were both fond of adventures, especially in
books, they were quite content to accept the
Zankiwank's offer to take them for a ride in
the midnight-express to Fable Land, over which,
as everybody knows, King &AElig;sop reigns. Maudie
was nine and a half and Willie was eight and
a quarter. Very nice ages indeed, unless you
happen to be younger or older, and then your
own age is nicer still.</p>

<p>"I think," said the Zankiwank, "that we will
start without the Bletherwitch. She knows the
way and can take a balloon."</p>

<p>"If she takes a balloon she will lose it. You
had better let the balloon take her," exclaimed
the Jackarandajam severely.</p>

<p>"Take your places! Take your places!" cried
the unseen porter. So everybody made a rush
for the train, and they all entered a Pullman
Car and sat down on the seats.</p>

<p>"Dear me! How very incorrectly that porter
speaks. He means, of course, that the seats
should take, or receive us."</p>

<p>The Zankiwank only smiled, while Mr Swinglebinks
commenced counting up to a hundred, but
as he lost one, he could only count up to ninety-nine&mdash;so,
to keep his arithmetic going, he subtracted
a time-piece from his neighbour's pocket,
multiplied his foot-warmers, and divided his attention
between the Wimble and the Wamble, who
were both of the party, being left-handed and deaf.</p>

<p>Maudie and Willie took their places in the
car with all the other passengers amid a perfect
babel of chattering and laughing and crying, and
then, as the train began to slowly move out of
the station, the Zankiwank solemnly sang the
following serious song:&mdash;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Off to Fable Land.</span></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The midnight train departs at three,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To Fable Land we go,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So off we go to Fable Land&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">(Speak kindly to the guard!)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which many think a Babel-land,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">So do not vex the guard!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Maudie and Willie found themselves joining
lustily in the chorus when the Zankiwank pulled
the cord communicating with the guard, and,
opening the window, climbed out on to the top
of the carriage calling all the time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Guard! Guard! Guard!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't go so hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Just give the brake a hitch!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Charing Cross return&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, do not look so stern&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I would not tell a cram,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must send a telegram,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To my darling little Bletherwitch."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So the guard turned the train round, and they
went back to Charing Cross as quick as lightning.</p>

<p>"It's my fault," moaned the Jackarandajam,
"I ought to have reminded you. Never mind,
we will put on another engine."</p>

<p>So the Zankiwank got out and sent a telegram
to the Bletherwitch, and desired her to follow on
in a balloon.</p>

<p>Again they started, and everybody settled
down until the train reached the British Channel,
when it dived through a tunnel into an uninhabited
country, where the post-office clerk
popped his head into the carriage window and
handed in a telegram.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>From the Bletherwitch,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>To the Zankiwank.</i><br /></span>
</div>
<p>Don't wait tea. Gone to the Dentists."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"Extremely thoughtful," exclaimed everybody.
But the Zankiwank wept, and explained to
the sympathetic Maude that he was engaged to
be married to the Bletherwitch, and he had
been waiting for her for fourteen years. "Such
a charming creature. I will introduce you when
she comes. Fancy, she is only two feet one
inch and one third high. Such a suitable height
for a bride."</p>

<p>"What," expostulated Willie and Maude together,
"she's no bigger than our baby! And
you are quite&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eight feet and one half of an inch."</p>

<p>"How disproportionate! It seems to me to
be a most unequal match," answered Maude.
"What does her mother say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she hasn't got any mother, you know.
That would not do. She has been asleep for
two thousand years, and has only just woke up
to the fact that I am her destiny."</p>

<p>"She is only joking," declared Maude. "Two
thousand years! She <i>must</i> be joking!"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Zankiwank somewhat sadly,
"she is not joking. She never jokes. She is
of Scottish descent," he added reflectively. "I
hope she will keep her appointment. I am
afraid she is rather giddy!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Giddy! Well, if she has waited two
thousand years before making up her mind to
go to the dentists she must be giddy. I am
afraid you are not speaking the truth."</p>

<p>Before any reply could be given the Guard
came to the window and said they would have
to go back to Charing Cross again as he forgot to
pay his rent, and he always paid his rent on Monday.</p>

<p>"But this is <i>not</i> Monday," said Willie. "Yesterday
was Monday. To-day is to-morrow you know,
therefore it is Tuesday. Pay your landlady double
next Monday and that will do just as well."</p>

<p>The Guard hesitated.</p>

<p>"Don't vex the Guard," they all said in
chorus.</p>

<p>"I am not vexed," said the Guard, touching
his hat. "Do you think it would be right to
pay double? You see my landlady is single.
She might not like it."</p>

<p>"Write 'I. O. U.' on a post-card and send
it to her. It will do just as well, if not better,"
suggested Mr Swinglebinks.</p>

<p>So the Guard sent the post-card; but in
his agitation he told the engineer driver to go
straight ahead instead of round the corner. The
consequence was that they were run into by a
Demon on a bicycle, and thrown out of the
train down a coal mine. Luckily there were
no coals in the mine so it did not matter, and
they went boldly forward&mdash;that is to say, Willie
and Maude did, and knocked at the front door
of a handsome house that suddenly appeared
before them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page17" id="Page17"></a>
<img src="images/z030.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Nobody opened the door, so they walked in.
They looked behind them, but could not see
the Zankiwank or any of the passengers in the
train; therefore, not knowing what else to do,
they went upstairs. They appeared to be walking
up stairs for hours
without coming to a landing
or meeting with anyone, and
the interminable steps began to
grow monotonous. Presently they heard a scuffling
and a stamping and a roaring behind them
and something or somebody began to push them
most rudely until at last the wall gave way, the
stairs gave way, they gave way, and tumbled right
on to the tips of their noses.</p>

<p>"Out of the way! Out of the way!" screamed
a chorus of curious voices, and Maude and Willie
found themselves taken by the hand by a weird-looking
dwarf with a swivel eye and an elevated
proboscis, and led out of danger.</p>

<p>The children could not help gazing upon
their preserver, who was so grotesquely formed,
with a humped back, twisted legs, very long
arms, and such a funny little body without
any neck. But his eyes atoned for everything&mdash;they
sparkled and glinted in their sockets
like bright brown diamonds&mdash;only there are no
brown diamonds, you know, only white and
pink ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page19" id="Page19"></a>
<img src="images/z032.jpg" width="600" height="684" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Dwarf did not appear to mind the wondering
looks of the children at all, but patted
them on the cheeks and told them not to be
frightened. But whether he meant frightened
of himself, or of the Birds, Beasts, and Fishes
that were hurrying by in such confusing masses,
they could not tell. One thing, however, that
astonished them very much
was the deference with which they
greeted their quaint rescuer, as they passed by.
For every creature from the Lion to the Mouse
bowed most politely as they approached him, and
then went on their way gaily frisking, for this
was their weekly half-holiday.</p>

<p>"How do you like my Menagerie," enquired
the Dwarf. "Rough and ready, perhaps, but as
docile as a flat-iron if you treat them properly."</p>

<p>"It is just like the Zoo," declared Willie. "Or
the animals in &AElig;sop's Fables," suggested Maude.</p>

<p>This delighted the Dwarf very much, for though
he looked so serious, he was full of good humour
and skipped about with much agility.</p>

<p>"Good! Good!" he cried. "&AElig;sop and the
Zoo! Ha! Ha! He! He! Anybody can be
a Zoo but only one can be &AElig;sop, and I am
he!"</p>

<p>"&AElig;sop! Are you really Mr &AElig;sop, the Phrygian
Philosopher?" cried Maude.</p>

<p>"<i>King</i> &AElig;sop, I should say," corrected Willie.
"I am glad we have met you, because now,
perhaps, you will kindly tell us what a Fable
really is."</p>

<p>"A Fable," said the merry &AElig;sop, with a twinkle
in his witty eyes, "is a fictitious story about
nothing that ever happened, related by nobody
that ever lived. And the moral is, that every one
is quite innocent, only they must not do it
again!"</p>

<p>"Ah! that is only your fun," said Willie sagely,
"because of the moral. Why do they give you
so many morals?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered &AElig;sop gravely. "But
the Commentators and Editors do give a lot of
applications and morals to the tales of my
animals, don't they?"</p>

<p>"I like a tale with a moral," averred Maude,
"it finishes everything up so satisfactorily, I think.
Now, Mr &AElig;sop, as you know so much, please
tell us what a proverb is?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied Mr &AElig;sop, "I don't make proverbs.
There are too many already, but a proverb
usually seems to me to be something you
always theoretically remember to practically forget."</p>

<p>Neither of the children quite understood this,
though Maude thought it was what her papa
would call satire, and satire was such a strange
word that she could never fully comprehend the
meaning.</p>

<p>Willie was silent too, like his sister, and seeing
them deep in thought, King &AElig;sop waved a little
wand he had in his hand, and all the Birds and
Beasts and Fishes joined hands and paws, and
fins and wings, and danced in a circle singing to
the music of a quantity of piping birds in the
trees:&mdash;</p>

<p>After merrily joining in this very original
song, with dancing accompaniment, Maude and
Willie thanked King &AElig;sop for permitting his
animals to entertain them.</p>

<p>"Always glad to please good little boys and
girls, you know," he replied pleasantly, "even in
their play they furnish us with a new fable and
a moral."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"All play and no work makes the world stand
still."</p>

</div>

<p>Before they could ask for an explanation, their
attention was once more drawn to the animals,
who had commenced playing all kinds of games
just the same as they themselves played in the
play-ground at school. The Toads were playing
Leap-frog; the Elephants and the Bears, Fly the
Garter; the Dromedaries, Hi! Spie! Hi! while
the snakes were trundling their hoops. The Lions
and the Lambs were playing at cricket with the
Donkeys as fielders and the Wombat as umpire.</p>

<p>The Frogs were in a corner by themselves
playing "Kiss in the Ring," and crying out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It isn't you! It isn't you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We none of us know what to do,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">in a very serio-comic manner. Then the Storks
and the Cranes and the Geese and the Ganders
were standing in a circle singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sally, Sally Waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sitting in the Moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the camel's daughters,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All through the afternoon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh Sally! Bo Sally!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where's your dusting pan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Sally! Fie Sally!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here is your young man!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">In another part the Crabs, the Sheep, and the
Fox, were vowing that London Bridge was Broken
Down, because they had not half-a-crown, which
seemed a curious reason. Then all the rest of the
wild creatures, Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, commenced
an extraordinary dance, singing, croaking,
flapping their fins and spreading their wings, to
these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We are a crowd of jolly boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All romping on the lea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We always make this merry noise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And do not wake the poppies,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who want to have a snore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was too ridiculous; they could recognise
every animal they had read about in &AElig;sop, and
they were all behaving in a manner they little
dreamed could be possible, out of a Night-mare.
But it certainly was not a Night-mare, though
they could distinguish several horses and ponies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/z040.jpg" width="600" height="720" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>They never seemed to stop in their games, and
even the Ants and the Gnats were playing&mdash;and
above all a game of football,&mdash;though as some
played according to Association and some to
Rugby rules, of course it was rather perplexing
to the on-lookers. When they grew tired of
watching the Animal World enjoying their
holiday, they turned to consult King &AElig;sop,
but to their astonishment, he was not near
them&mdash;he had vanished! And when they
turned round the other way the Animals had
vanished too, and they were quite alone. Indeed
everything seemed to disappear, even the
light that had been their guide so long, and
they began to tremble with fear and apprehension.</p>

<p>Not a sound was to be heard, and darkness
gradually fell around them. They held each other
by the hand, and determined to go forward, but to
their dismay they could not move! They were
glued to the earth. They tried to speak, but
their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths,
and they were in great distress. "Where, Oh
where was the Zankiwank?" they wondered in
their thoughts. And a buzzing in their ears took
up the refrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Zankiwank, the Zankiwank,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh where, Oh where is the Zankiwank?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brought us here, and much we fear<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His conduct's far from Franky-wank!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Zankiwank, the Zankiwank,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He has gone to seek the Bletherwitch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh the Zankiwank, 'tis a panky prank<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To leave us here to die in a ditch.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"A telegram, did you say? For me, of course,
what an age you have been. How is my blushing
bride? Let me see&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>From the Bletherwitch, Nonsuch Street,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>To the Zankiwank, Nodland.</i><br /></span>
</div>

<p>Forgot my new shoes, and the housemaid's
killed the parrot. Put the kettle on.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then the children heard some sobbing sound
soughing through the silence and they knew that
they were saved. Also that the Zankiwank was
weeping. So with a strong effort Maude managed
to call out consolingly, "Zankiwanky, dear! don't
cry, come and let me comfort you."</p>

<p>But the Zankiwank refused to be comforted.
However, he came forward muttering an incantation
of some sort, and Maude and Willie finding
themselves free, rushed forward and greeted him.</p>

<p>"Hush, my dears, the Nargalnannacus is afloat
on the wild, wild main. We must be careful
and depart, or he will turn us into something
unpleasant&mdash;the last century or may be the next,
as it is close at hand, and inexpensive. Follow
me to the ship that is waiting in the Bay Window,
and we will go and get some Floranges."</p>

<p>Carefully Maudie and Willie followed the
Zankiwank, each holding on by the tails of
his coat, glad enough to go anywhere out of the
Blackness of the Dark.</p>

<p>Soon they found themselves in Window Bay,
and climbing up the sides of a mighty ship with
five funnels and a red-haired captain.</p>

<p>"Quick," called the Captain, "the Nargalnannacus
is on the lee scuppers just off the jibboom
brace. Make all sail for the Straights of Ballambangjan,
and mind the garden gate."</p>

<p>Then the Zankiwank became the man at the
wheel, and the vessel scudded before the wind as
the two children went off into a trance.</p>

<h2>The Fairies' Feather and<br />
Flower Land</h2>


<p>How long Maude and Willie had been
rocking in the cradle of the deep
they could not tell, nor how long it took them
to steam through the Straits of Ballambangjan,
for everything was exceptionally bleak and
blank to them. By the way, if you cannot find
the Straits of Ballambangjan in your Geography
or on the Map, you should consult the first sailor
you meet, and he will give you as much information
on the subject as any boy or girl need
require.</p>

<p>Both children experienced that curious sensation
of feeling asleep while they were wide awake,
and feeling wide awake when they imagined
themselves to be asleep, just as one does feel
sometimes in the early morning, when the sun
is beginning to peep through the blinds, and
the starlings are chattering, and the sparrows
are tweeting under the eaves, outside the
window.</p>

<p>They were no longer on the vessel that had
borne them away from Fableland, and the
approach of the Nargalnannacus, a fearsome
creature whom nobody has yet seen, although
most of us may not have heard about him.</p>

<p>The obliging Zankiwank was with them, and
when they looked round they found themselves
in a square field festooned with the misty curtains
of the Elfin Dawn.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Zankiwank, "this is Midsummer
Day, and very soon it will be Midsummer
Night, and you will see some wonders that will
outwonder all the wonders that wonderful people
have ever wondered both before and afterwards.
Listen to the Flower-Fairies&mdash;not the garden
flowers, but the wild-flowers; they will sing you
a song, while I beat time&mdash;not that there is any
real need to beat Time, because he is a most
respectable person, though he always contrives to
beat us."</p>

</div>

<p>Both children would have liked to argue out
this speech of the Zankiwank because it puzzled
them, and they felt it would not parse properly.
However, as just at that moment the Elfin
Orchestra appeared, they sat on the grass and
listened:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They keep very good time, don't they?" said
the Zankiwank to the children, who were completely
entranced with pleasure and surprise.</p>

<p>"Lovely, lovely," was all they could say.</p>

<p>Every wild flower they could think of, and
every bird of the air, was to be seen in this
beautiful place with the
purling stream running
down the centre, crossed by innumerable
rustic bridges, while
far away they could see a fountain
ever sending upward its cooling
sprays of crystal water.</p>

</div>

<p>"I think I shall spend my honeymoon
here," said the Zankiwank.
"I have already bought a honeycomb
for my bride. I am so impatient to have
her by my side that I have dispatched the
Jackarandajam and Mr Swinglebinks in a four-wheeled
cab to fetch her. When the Bletherwitch
arrives I will introduce you, and you shall both be
bridesmaids!"</p>

<p>"But I can't be a bridesmaid, you know," corrected
Willie.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you can. You can be anything here
you like. You only have to eat some Fern seeds
and you become invisible, and nobody would
know you. It is so simple, and saves a lot of
argument. And you should never argue about
anything unless you know nothing about it, then
you are sure to win."</p>

<p>"But," interrupted Maude, "how can you know
nothing about anything?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the easiest thing out of the world," said
the Zankiwank. "What is nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Precisely. Nothing is nothing; but what is
better than nothing?"</p>

<p>"Something."</p>

<p>"Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Where is your
logic? Nothing is better than something! I'll
prove it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nothing is sweeter than honey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing's more bitter than gall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing that's comic is funny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing is shorter than tall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That is nonsense and nothing to do with
the case," exclaimed Maude.</p>

<p>"Nonsense? Nonsense? Did you say nonsense?"</p>

<p>"Of course she did," said Willie, "and so do I."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! To me? Do you forget what my
name is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, nothing easier than to remember it.
You are the Great Zankiwank."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I am satisfied. I thought you
had forgotten. I am not cross with you."</p>

<p>Maude and Willie vowed they would not cross
him for anything, let alone nothing, and so the
Zankiwank was appeased and offered to give
them the correct answer to his own unanswerable
conundrum. Do you know what a conundrum
is though? I will tell you while the
Zankiwank is curling his whiskers:&mdash;</p>

<p>A conundrum is an impossible question with
an improbable answer. Think it over the next
time you read "Robinson Crusoe."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nothing is better than a good little girl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a jam tart is better than nothing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore a jam tart is better than the best little girl alive."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"What do you think of that?" said the
Zankiwank.</p>

<p>"I have heard something like it before. But
that is nothing. Anyhow I would much rather
be a little girl than a jam tart&mdash;because a jam tart
must be sour because it's tart, and a little girl
is always sweet," promptly replied Willie, kissing
his sister Maude on the nose&mdash;but that was an
accident, because she moved at the wrong moment.</p>

<p>"You distress me," said the Zankiwank. "Suppose
I were to try to shoot Folly as it flies, and hit a
Fool's Cap and Bells instead, what would you say?"</p>

<p>"I should say that you had shot at nothing
and missed it."</p>

<p>At this Maude and
Willie laughed girlsterously
and boysterously,
and the Zankiwank
wept three silent
tears in the teeth
of the wind and
declared
that nothing
took his
fancy so
much as having nothing to
take. So they took him
by the arm and begged him,
as he was so clever and had
mentioned the name, to take
them to Fancy's dwelling-place.</p>

<p>"I think Fancy must dwell amongst the wild
flowers&mdash;the sweet beautiful wild flowers that
grow in such charming variety of disorder."
Saying this, Maude took Willie's hand and
urged the Zankiwank forward.</p>

<p>Before the Zankiwank could reply, a company
of fairies, all dressed in pink and green, leapt
from the petals of the flowers and danced forward,
singing to the buzz of the bees and the breaking
note of the yellow-ammer with his bright gamboge
breast:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i1">But in the tender heart.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As mysteriously as they had appeared, the
fairies vanished again, and only the rustling of
the leaves and the twittering of the birds making
melody all around, reminded the children that they
were on enchanted ground. Now and then the
bull-frogs would set up a croaking chorus in
some marshy land far behind, but as no one
could distinguish what they said it did not
matter.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O to be here for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the fairy band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O to wake up never<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For the humblest plant is weighted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some new perfume,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And mingles with the bloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O to be here for ever, and never, never wake.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Was that the music of the spheres they
wondered? Somehow it seemed as though their
own hearts' echo played to the words that fell so
soft, like a fair sweet tender melody of fairies
long ago.</p>

<p>The Zankiwank had left them again, to send
another telegram, perhaps, and Maude and Willie
went rambling through the meadow and down by
the brook, where they gathered nuts and berries
and sat them down to enjoy a rural feast.</p>

<p>Tiny elves and fairies were constantly coming
and going, some driving in wee chariots with ants
for horses and oak leaves for carriages. And
while all the other flowers seemed quite gay and
merry in the sunshine, the Poppies were nodding
their scarlet heads and gently dozing, what time
some wild Holly Hocks beat to and fro murmuring&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sleep! Sleep! Sleep!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While the corn is ready to reap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep! Sleep! Sleep!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the lightest hours a-creep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep! Sleep! Sleep!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the edge of the misty deep.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As they lay upon the bank, to their surprise a
procession of birds came along, the two foremost
being fine handsome thrushes, carrying a large
banner of ivy leaves, on which was inscribed, in
letters of red clover, the following legend:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">Bean-Feast of Birds<br />
from London and<br />
the Suburbs.</p>

<p>"Fancy," said Maude, "all the birds of London
Town come to Fairy-land for a change of air!"</p>

<p>"And why not?" asked a saucy Cock-sparrow.
"We can't be always singing the same song, so
we come here for a change of air, and of course
when we get a change of air we return with new
melodies. If you were to Reed your books properly
you would know that the Pipes of our
Organs&mdash;our vocal Organs&mdash;want tuning occasionally."</p>

<p>Then, without any warning, they all struck up
a new song, and marvel of marvels, instead of
merely singing like ordinary birds, they sang the
words as well. But before giving you the lyric
that they voiced so melodiously I must tell you
the names of some of the birds they saw, and if
you live in London or any large town you will
perhaps know several of them by sight, as well
as by cognomen. First in the throng were the
Mistle-Thrushes and the song Thrushes; the Redwing
and the Fieldfare, the Blackbird and the
Redstart, and the Redbreast with faithful Jenny
Wren; the large family of Titmouse and the
merry Chiff-chaff, with his pleasant little song of
"Chiff-chaff; chiff-chaff; chiv-chave." The humoursome
Wagtails and that rare visitant the Waxwing,
hopped along together, followed by the
Swallows and the Martins, and a whole posse
of Finches of various orders, particularly the
Chaffinches who were joking with the Linnets.</p>

</div>

<p>Then came the noisy Starlings,
the Magpies and the
Sparrows chattering incessantly and evidently
talking scandal. The sly Jackdaws and the
Ravens looking as sleek as Sunday Sextons, but
evidently plotting mischief, were also present, in
close proximity to the Rooks and the Crows, who
were well able to take care of their own caws.
Afterwards came the Swifts and the Larks up to
all sorts of games. A few Woodpeckers joined
their feathered friends, and one Cuckoo was there,
because Willie heard him, but he kept somewhere
in the background as usual. Owls and Bats and
Millards with Wigeons and Pigeons brought up
the rear with a few Plovers, including the Lapwing.
Jack Snipe came tumbling after in a
hurry, with a stranger called the Whimbrel and a
Puffin out of breath. There were other birds as
well, but I don't think you would know them if I
mentioned them. Maude and Willie did not, and
they were quite authorities on ornithology, and
perhaps you are not.</p>

<p>After this very entertaining song each bird
stood on one leg, spread one wing, and joined
partners for one of the prettiest dances you ever
saw. It was called the Birds' Quadrille, and was
so charmingly executed that even the flowers left
their beds and borders to look on&mdash;the fairies
peeping meanwhile from the buds to join in the
general enjoyment. The voices of the flowers were
lifted in gentle cadences to the rhythm of the
feathered dancers' featly twists and turns.</p>

<p>How happy the children felt in this beautiful
place with all Nature vieing to show her sweetest
charms. And how rich and rare were the gems
of foliage and tree and humble creeping plants.
How easy to forget everything&mdash;but joy&mdash;in this
fairy paradise that Fancy so deftly pictured for
them! Could there be anything sad in Flower
Land? They could not believe it possible, and
yet when a tiny little fairy stepped from a cluster
of wild flowers and sang them the song of the Lily
and the Rose, diamond tears stole down the cheeks
of the little lass and the little lad.</p>

<p>Before the children had time to grow too sorrowful,
there was a fluttering in the air and a rushing
among the plants and flowers as the Zankiwank
bounded into their presence, cutting so many
capers that they were glad they were not to
have mutton for dinner, as certainly all the
capers would be destroyed.</p>

<p>The Zankiwank was in very high spirits, and
gleefully announced that the Court of the Fairies,
with the Queen, was coming, as Sally who lived
in somebody's alley had just informed him. Then
he burst out singing to a tune, which I daresay you
all know, the following foolish words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of all the flowers that are so smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There's none like Daffydilly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She'd be the darling of my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But she has grown so silly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no wild flower in the land<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That's half so tame as Daisy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her I'd give my heart and hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But fear I'd drive her crazy!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then there is the Cabbage Rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Also the China Aster;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Buttercup with yellow nose<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Would cause jealous disaster.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget-me-not, O Violet dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Primrose, you know my passion!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the plants afar&mdash;anear<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I court in flowery fashion!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, please be serious!" cried Willie. "<i>What</i>
is the matter with you, Mr Zankiwank?"</p>

<p>You will perceive that Willie and Maude were
quite at home in their new surroundings, and
nothing seemed to surprise them one whit, not
even the unexpected which they constantly
anticipated.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page61" id="Page61"></a>
<img src="images/z074.jpg" width="600" height="629" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Zankiwank only asked permission to send
one more telegram to the Bletherwitch, and then
he condescended to inform them that Queen
Titania was about to pay a visit to the Flowers
and the Birds, and sure enough, before he had
done speaking, Titania arrived all the way from
Athens, with a full train of fairies and elves,
accompanied by a fairy band playing fairy
music. Robin Goodfellow skipped in advance,
while Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustard-seed
attended on the lovely Queen.</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed this must be a Midsummer
Night's Dream!"</p>

<p>"Indeed and indeed then it is," mocked the
impudent Robin Goodfellow. "The fairies are
not dead yet; and they never will die while
good little girls and boys, and poets with sweet
imaginations, live. But quick, let not the Queen
see you! Eat of these Fern Seeds and you will
become invisible even to the fairies. They are
special seeds of my own growing and warranted to
last as long as I choose."</p>

<p>So Maude and Willie ate of the Fern Seeds
and became invisible, even to the Zankiwank,
who was dreadfully distressed and
went about calling them by
name. In a spirit
of mischief Willie
pinched his exceedingly
thin
legs, making him
jump as high as
an April rain-bow,
and causing him to be called to order
by the Court Usher.</p>

<img src="images/z077.jpg" width="480" height="627" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"And now," said Titania, waving her wand and
calling the Flowers and Birds to her Court, "let
the Jackdaw sing his well-known War Song."</p>


<p>"If you please,
your majesty, I
have left the music
at home and forgotten
the words,"
pleaded the Jackdaw.</p>

<p>"Very well, then
sing it without either or you shall not have a
new coat until the Spring."</p>

<p>So the Jackdaw stepped forth and sang as
below, while the Rook irreverently cleared his
throat above for his friend, and cried "Caw!
Caw!"</p>

<p>"That's a very nice War Song&mdash;it's so peaceful
and soothing," spake the Queen. "And now
call the Poets from Freeland. This is the time
for them to renew their licences, though I greatly
fear that they have been taking so many liberties
of late that any licence I can give them will
prove superfluous."</p>

<p>"Superfluous! Superfluous! That <i>is</i> a good
word," muttered the Zankiwank. "I wonder
what it means?" Whereupon he went and asked
Robin Goodfellow and all the other Fairies, but
as nobody knew, it did not matter, and the Poets
arriving at that moment he thought of a number
and sat on a toadstool.</p>


<p>Maude recognised several of the Poets who came
to have their licences renewed&mdash;she had heard
of "poetic licence" before, but never dreamed
that one had to get the unwritten freedom from
Fairyland. But so it was. Several of the Poets
seemed to be exorbitant in their demands, and
wanted to make their poems all licence, but this
Titania would not consent to, so they went
away singing, all in tune too, a little piece that
Robin Goodfellow said was a Rondel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="noin">So on their way they went rejoicing&mdash;saying
pretty things to the fairies, the flowers and the
birds, for they are their best friends you know,
and they love all Nature with a vast and all-embracing,
all-enduring love.</p>

<p>One singer as he went along chanted half-sadly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To tell of other's joys the poet sings;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To tell of Love, its sweets and eke its pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tenderest songs his magic fancy strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of Love, perchance, that he may never gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearts may not break and passion may be weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But O the grief of Love that dare never speak!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A light-hearted bard then took up the cue
and carolled these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's so much prose in life that now and then,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A tender song of pity stirs the heart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sing, poets! sing for aye your sweetest strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For life without its poetry were vain!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then they all sang together a song of May,
although Queen Titania had declared that it was
Midsummer. Perhaps her Midsummer lasts all
the year round:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Their fragrance shed upon the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As though 'twere ever May.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the Poets went on their happy way, the last
one to depart turned to where Maude was standing,
and though he could not possibly see her, said
gently:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O grant you, little maiden, your thoughts be aye sincere,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your dreams turn into actions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your pleasures know no sear:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your life be flowers and sunshine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your days be free from tear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How happy it made her! And what beautiful
things these poets always thought of and
said!</p>

<p>"Now, Peaseblossom and
Mustard Seed, you may sing
that little song that I made
for you when we were floating
up near the Moon, and
then we shall soon have to
depart as we have so many
calls to make this Midsummer
Night."</p>

<p>Neither Willie nor Maude
could understand how it
could be Midsummer Night,
because Midsummer Day
was such a long way off&mdash;quite
six weeks, for this
was only yet the month of
May. But they did not say anything, because
Robin Goodfellow was looking at them, and they
knew they were invisible, because they could
not even feel themselves&mdash;which is a curious
sensation, when you come to think of it.</p>

<p>Now, this is the song that Peaseblossom and
Mustard Seed sang together in unison&mdash;the fairies,
led by Robin Good fellow, joining in the chorus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's all very well," exclaimed the Zankiwank.
"Roses are always delightful, especially the
Cabbage Roses, because you can eat them for
breakfast, but every rose has its drawback....
Ho! and it's thorn," he added, dancing with pain,
for at that moment several rose bushes he was
passing by gave him a good pricking.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Queen Titania, "that is not the
way to look at the beautiful things of life. It is
because the thorns have roses that we should be
thankful, and not find fault because the roses have
thorns."</p>

<p>"That is a sentiment that I can endorse&mdash;it
is a true bill, and almost as good as one of
my own," replied Robin Goodfellow saucily; "and
now let us wander through the Florange grove
and gather some Moranges and Lemons."</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page75" id="Page75"></a>
<img src="images/z088.jpg" width="600" height="714" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Neither Maude nor Willie had heard of Floranges
or Moranges, and wondered what sort of fruit
they could be, when their attention was drawn
once more to Queen Titania and her court of
fairies, who were all seated beneath the greenwood
tree eating puddings and pies that Mustard
Seed and Peaseblossom and Cobweb were making
for them, chanting, as they cooked the pastry by
the fire of their own eloquence, this doggerel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First you take a little orange,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And you squeeze out all the pips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then you add a crimson florange,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which you cut up into chips.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then you stir them in a porringe,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With your tiny finger tips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you have the finest morange<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ever known to mortal lips.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How Willie and Maude longed to taste a
morange! The Zankiwank evidently enjoyed
the one he had, for he said it tasted just like
mango, ice cream, blackberries and plum tart
all mixed up together, so that it must have
been nice.</p>

<p>After the feast Titania said she must be going,
as she felt certain that there were some invisible
mortals present. She could hear them breathing!
At this Robin Goodfellow grew nervous, and the
children got frightened lest the Queen should
discover and punish them for their temerity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where Christmas pudding's bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis folly to eat pies,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">cried Robin Goodfellow to divert attention and
the fairies at the same time, but the Queen was
not satisfied, and ordered a special dress train
to carry them away again.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 544px;">
<a name="Page79" id="Page79"></a>
<img src="images/z092.jpg" width="544" height="800" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>At this moment the two children tumbled off
nothing into a vacant space, making the Zankiwank
scream out&mdash;"It must be the Bletherwitch in the
clutches of the Nargalnannacus." But it wasn't,
and if it had not been for Robin Goodfellow's
presence of mind, I am sure I do not know
what would have happened. That lively rascal,
however, guessing that he had used the wrong
seeds, at once stepped forward, and taking Maude
and Willie each by the hand, boldly presented
them to Her Majesty as being favoured mortals
who were friends of the Zankiwank, and so the
Queen received them and asked them more questions
than you could find in any school book.
None of which they answered, because when they
turned round the Queen and all her court had
vanished, and only the Zankiwank was to be
seen.</p>

<p>The Zankiwank took no notice of them whatever,
and behaved just as though he could not
see them. They called him by name without
arousing his attention, for he was once more
writing a telegram, only he did not know where
to send it. In the distance Maude could hear
the sound of voices, and she declared she could
recognise the Queen singing, though Willie said
it must have been her imagination because he
could not. However, this is what Maude said
she heard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear little maid, may joy be thine<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As through your life you go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Truth and Peace each act design,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That Hope turn not to woe.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dream if you will in maiden prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But let each dream be true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For idle hopes waste golden time,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That won't return to you.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In after years when ways divide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Love dispels each tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know in some breast there will abide<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A thought for you sincere.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So strive, dear maid, to play your part,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With noble aim and deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let sweetness ever sway your heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And so I give you speed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While Maudie was pondering over the meaning
of these words, she was suddenly lifted off her
feet, and, when she recovered from the shock,
found herself with Willie in a balloon, while
down below the Zankiwank was fondly embracing
the Jackarandajam, who had just arrived with
a whole army of odd-looking people, including
Jack-the-Giant-Killer, Tom Thumb, Blue Beard,
and all his wives, with Sister Anne, Dick Whittington,
and his black cat, and Tom Tiddler, and
about three thousand four hundred and five
goblins and sprites, who all commenced running
a race up and down the valley from which they
were fast speeding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/z096.jpg" width="600" height="714" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Keep the pot a-boiling; keep the pot a-boiling,"
bawled the Zankiwank, and away they all went
again, helter skelter, in and out, and up and
down, like skaters on a rink.</p>

<p>Gradually the balloon altered its course, and
instead of going up it went straight ahead to a
large inpenetrable wall that seemed to threaten
them with destruction; while, to the annoyance
of both Maude and Willie, they could hear the
revellers down below dancing and singing as
though they were in no jeopardy. And if the
words had been correct they would have declared
that it was the Mariners of England who were
singing their own song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You sleepy little mortals,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">High up in a balloon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You soon will pass the portals,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beyond the crescent moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Shadowland will come in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A dream within a dream;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So keep in your sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i3">While we keep up the steam;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While the midnight hours are all a-creep,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And we are all a-beam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The spirits of the fairies<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This eve are very bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in your nest the mare is<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who only rides by night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a magic sphere you go,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A dream within a dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So keep in your sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">While we keep up the steam,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Shadow Land is deep and steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And we are all a-beam.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With a bump, and a thump, and a jump, the
balloon burst against the wall, and Maude and
Willie felt themselves dropping, dropping, dropping,
until the Zankiwank bounced up and caught them
both in his arms, saying as he rushed forward:&mdash;</p>


<p>"Quick, the gates are only open for five seconds
once a week, and if we don't get inside at once
we shall be jammed in the door-way."</p>

with a boom and a bang after them.</p>

<h2>A Visit to Shadow Land</h2>


<p>"This," cheerily explained the Zankiwank, "is
Shadow Land, where everything is mist,
though nothing is ever found, because nothing is ever
lost, for you cannot lose nothing unless you have
nothing to gain. Consequently I shall leave you
to find out everything else," with which nonsensical
introduction the Zankiwank caught hold of the
wings of a house, sprang on to the gables, and
flew down the nearest chimney, followed by all
the dancers they had seen below, including the
Jackarandajam and all the residents from Story-Book
Land of whom you can think. But if you
cannot think of all of them yourself, ask your
sisters to think for you.</p>

<p>It certainly was a Land of Shadows, where revolving
lights like flashes from a lighthouse sent
all sorts of varying rays right through the mists,
presenting to them a fresh panorama of views
every other minute or so. The shadows danced
all through the place, which seemed like a large
plateau or table-land, near a magnificent stretch
of ocean which they could see before them with
ships passing to and fro incessantly. And all the
time, goblins, hob, nob and otherwise, red, blue,
and green, kept rushing backwards and forwards,
sometimes with a whole school of children following
madly in their wake. Such a dashing and a
crashing was never seen or heard before, and as
each creature carried his shadow with him, you can
just imagine what a lot of lights and shades there
must have been. Occasionally there would be a
slight lull in the excitement, and the racing and
the rushing would cease for awhile. Each time
that there was a pause in the seemingly endless
races, a quaint round-faced little person, dressed
in short petticoats, sky blue stockings and a
crimson peaked hat, stepped from Nowhere in
particular, and either sang a song herself or
introduced a small girl spirit, or boy spirit, who
did so for her.</p>

</div>

<p>The first time, she descended on to the plateau
on a broom, and introduced herself by throwing
a light from the magic lantern which she carried,
on to a sheet of water which she unfolded, and
thereon appeared this announcement:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center1">I am the Great Little Winny Weg.</p>

<p>But as neither Willie nor Maude knew what a
Winny Weg was, they were necessarily compelled
to await further developments. However, as none
came, they listened carefully to her song, which,
as far as I can remember, was like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The two children were so absorbed in listening
to this rhyming rigmarole that they did not observe
the Winny Weg depart, though, when they
came to think of it, the last verse was sung in the
clouds, and presumably by the Funny Little
Man himself, and they quite longed for him
to pay them a call. But he didn't, so the
goblins started off once more on their wild
career, this time on horseback, making such
a hammering and a clattering as almost to
deafen them.</p>

<p>Quickly in the rear of the white horses and the
spirits, who all wore little round caps with tassels
at the top, came a procession of dolls&mdash;wax dolls,
wooden dolls, and saw-dust dolls, very finely
dressed, with here and there a doll who had lost
a leg, or an arm, or a head, while some were quite
cripples, and had to be carried by a train of tiny
girls in very short frocks and very long sashes.
At the head of these appeared the Winny Weg
again, and just as they were vanishing in the
shadows, a regular shower of broken dolls came
down in dreadful disorder, causing the children to
break from their ranks to gather up their property,
as the dolls, it was evident, were their own old
companions which they had discarded when new
ones were given to them. One particularly disreputable
doll, with a broken nose and a
very battered body, was claimed by the prettiest
child of all, and as she picked it up, she
stepped into the centre of a ring formed by
her school-fellows, and recited to them this
pathetic poem:&mdash;</p>

<p>After this affecting recital they all took out
their "hankelwiches," as the owner of the Unfortunate
Doll said, and placing themselves in line,
they followed, as mourners, the remains of the
deceased doll to the end of a back garden,
which some of the goblins had brought in with
them. Then everything faded away again, and
more shadows danced on the land and the sea,
until nothing was to be seen but the galloping
sprites and the Winny Weg, who was dancing in
a corner all by herself.</p>

<p>A pink light now burst through the haze, the
goblins rode off, and a perfect fairy-land nursery
was unfolded before Maude and Willie, who were
reclining peacefully on a golden couch with silver
cushions. They had no desire to talk, but were
content to drink in all that they saw rapturously
and silently. The nursery was crowded, wee
baby-kins were crawling about everywhere, with
a dozen coy cupid-like dots with bows and
arrows. And right away at the back a beautiful
garden was disclosed, in which happy young
couples were seen perambulating arm-in-arm,
talking soft nothings to each other. Meanwhile
the crawling babies in the Universal Nursery
began to stand up; and then commenced such
a game of leap-frog by these tiny mites, that
made even the Cheshire Cat smile. It was so
funny to hear these dots call out to each other
to tuck in their "tuppennies," and to see them
flying, without stopping to take breath, over each
other's backs. Even the little pink and blue
cupids laughed until the babies crept back to
their cribs once more, and were rocked off to
sleep as the Winny Weg waved her wand, and
an unseen choir of little girls and boys was
heard singing this Lullaby:&mdash;</p>

<p>The slight mist that had descended went up
just like a gauze curtain, bringing into view
again the lovely garden reposing in the rear in a
beautiful green bath of light.</p>

<p>Then the merry Winny Weg caught hold of the
cupids and incited them to dance a slow gavotte,
and as they danced they warbled lusciously:&mdash;</p>

<p>How delicious and soothing Shadow Land was!
Shadow Land! The Land of Yesterday, To-Day
and To-morrow. The Land of Hope, and Joy and
Peace. The two children wandered off, as it were,
into a dream for a time, and when they gazed
again, the garden was more delightful than ever&mdash;a
joyous blend of Spring and Summer seemed to
invade the grounds, while many of the flowers and
trees showed slight signs of Autumn tinting. In
one corner of the garden a magnificent marble and
bronze fountain unexpectedly sprang up through
the ground and played unceasingly to the ethereal
skies. Merry children danced and played around
its base, and lovers young and old promenaded
affectionately up and down the innumerable
groves, stopping now and then to offer each other
a draught of the sparkling water that fell so
deliciously into the amber cups.</p>

<p>There were no shadows now. All was bright
and glorious; sunlight and pleasure reigned
supreme. From the clouds unseen singers sang
softly to the people as they passed and repassed,
and this was the story of their song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The voices faded and died away; the scene
changed and a purple curtain descended, hiding
everything and everybody except the Winny Weg.
An extraordinary commotion outside warned the
half-dozing children that a fresh flight of goblins
might be expected. And sure enough in stalked
an army of giants from one side, who were met by
an army of dwarfs from the other, the latter on
stilts. But the curious thing about them was that
the giants had only got one eye, which was stuck
on the ends of their noses, while the dwarfs had
their eyes where their ears ought to be, and their
ears in the place usually reserved for the eyes.
Besides which they each had a large horn fixed in
the middle of their foreheads.</p>

<p>Both armies expressed surprise at seeing each
other, the leaders of which said quite calmly, as
though they were asking one another to have a
penny bun cut up in four between them&mdash;both
said quite calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose we must fight now we have met?"</p>

<p>Upon hearing this the Winny Weg mounted
her broom-stick and flew up out of harm's way.</p>

<p>And then commenced the most terrible battle
ever seen on land or sea. They fought with
penknives and darning-needles, the battle lasted
half an hour, and only one stilt was injured. So
they began again, using coal scuttles and tongs,
and the din was so fearful, and the giants and the
dwarfs got so mixed up that a railway train
filled with Shadows of the Past rushed on and sent
both armies flying. Then the shadows deepened
and deepened, and the lightning flashed, the
thunders crashed, the sea roared, and a great red
cavern opened and swallowed up everything, including
Maude and Willie, who certainly were
not quite awake to what was going forward, and
all they could recollect of the occurrence was
that they saw the winkles and the shrimps on the
sea-shore playing at bowls with the cockles.</p>

<h2>The Land of Topsy Turvey</h2>


<p>If Maude and Willie had been in a state of
somnolency during their sojourn in Shadow
Land, they felt themselves very much awake on
reaching the land of Topsy Turvey. They knew
they were in Topsy Turvey Land because they
were greeted with a jingling chorus to that effect
immediately they opened their eyes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O this is Topsy Turvey Land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where ev'ry one is gay and bland,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And day is always night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We welcome to all strangers give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For by their custom we must live,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because we're so polite.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O this is Topsy Turvey Land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all our goods are in demand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By mortal, fay and sprite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our novelties are warranted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the land their fame is spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because we're so polite.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Surely they had been whisked back to Charing
Cross again without knowing it? The long wide
thoroughfare in which the children now found
themselves was just like one of the main shopping
streets in London. Some parts reminded them
of Regent Street, some of the Strand, and some
of Oxford Street. Yes, and there was the Lowther
Arcade, only somehow a little different. It was
odd. Toy shops, novelty stores, picture shops,
and shops of all sorts and sizes greeted them on
either hand. Moreover, there were the shopkeepers
and their assistants, and crowds of people
hurrying by, jostling the loungers and the gazers;
and the one policeman, who was talking to a fat
person in a print gown who was standing at the
area steps of the only private house they could
see. They were wondering what they should do
when the policeman cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come along there! Now then, move on!"
How rude of him. However, they "moved on,"
and were nearly knocked down by the Zankiwank,
who darted into the post-office to receive a telegram
and to send one in reply.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page123" id="Page123"></a>
<img src="images/z136.jpg" width="600" height="780" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>They followed him, of course; they knew the
telegram was from the Bletherwitch, and the
Zankiwank read it out to them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nblockquot">"Fashions in bonnets changed. Have ordered
six mops. Don't forget the cauliflower.
Postpone the wedding at once. No
cards."</p>

<p>"Now what does that mean," murmured the
expectant bridegroom. "My Bletherwitch cannot
be well. I'll send her some cough lozenges."
So he wrote a reply and despatched it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nblockquot">"Take some cough drops every five minutes.
Have ordered cucumber for supper. Pay
the cabman and come by electricity."</p>

<p>"That certainly should induce her to come,
don't you think so? She is so very sensitive.
Well, I must not be impatient, she is exceedingly
charming when you catch her in the right
mood."</p>

<p>Maude scarcely believed that the Bletherwitch
could possess so many charms, or she would not
keep her future husband waiting so long for her.
But she knew it was useless offering any advice
on so delicate a subject, so she and Willie begged
the Zankiwank to be their guide and to show them
the Lions of Topsy Turvey, which he readily
agreed to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 675px;">
<a name="Page126" id="Page126"></a>
<img src="images/z139.jpg" width="675" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>And now, as they left the post-office, they
turned their attention to the shops and were
surprised to read the names over the windows
of several individuals they had already met in
the train. For instance, the Wimble lived next
door to the Wamble, and each one had printed
in the window a very curious legend.</p>

<p>This is what the Wamble had:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">Good Resolutions Bought, Sold<br />
and Exchanged.</p>

<p class="center">A FEW BAD, AND SOME SLIGHTLY DAMAGED,<br />
TO BE DISPOSED OF&mdash;A BARGAIN.</p>

<p class="center"><i>No connection with the business next door.</i></p>

<p>While the Wimble stated the nature of his wares
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">Bad Resolutions Bought, Sold<br />
and Exchanged.</p>

<p class="center">A FEW GOOD, AND SOME SLIGHTLY INDIFFERENT,<br />
TO BE DISPOSED OF&mdash;A BARGAIN.</p>

<p class="center"><i>No connection with the business next door.</i></p>

<p>"No connection with the business next door,"
repeated Willie.</p>

<p>"Why, you told us that they were brothers&mdash;twins,"
indignantly cried Maude.</p>

<p>"So they are! So they are! Don't you see
they are twins from a family point of view only.
In business, of course, they are desperately opposed
to each other. That is why they are so prosperous,"
explained the Zankiwank.</p>

<p>"Are they prosperous? I never heard of such
a thing as buying and selling Resolutions. How
can one buy a Good Resolution?" enquired Maude.</p>

<p>"Or exchange Bad Resolutions," said Willie.
"It is quite wicked."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Not at all. So many people
make Good Resolutions and never carry
them out, therefore if there were no place
where you could dispose of them they would
be wasted."</p>

<p>"But Bad Resolutions? Nobody makes Bad
Resolutions&mdash;at least they ought not to, and I
don't believe it is true!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interrupted the Zankiwank. "If
you make a Good Resolution and don't carry it
out&mdash;doesn't it become a Bad Resolution? Answer
me that."</p>

<p>This, however, was an aspect of the question
that had never occurred to them, and they were
unable to reply.</p>

<p>"It seems to me to be nonsense&mdash;and worse
than nonsense&mdash;for one brother to deal in Bad
Resolutions and the other in Good Resolutions.
Why do not they become a Firm and mix the two
together?" responded Maude.</p>

<p>"You horrify me! Mix the Good and the
Bad together? That would never do. The Best
Resolutions in the world would be contaminated
if they were all warehoused under one roof.
Besides, the Wimble is himself full of Good
Resolutions, so that he can mingle with the Bad
without suffering any evil, while the Wamble is
differently constituted!"</p>

<p>The children did not understand the Zankiwank's
argument a bit&mdash;it all seemed so ridiculous.
A sudden thought occurred to Willie.</p>

<p>"Who, then, collects the Resolutions?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a person of no Resolution whatever. He
commenced life with only one Resolution, and he
lost it, or it got mislaid, or he never made use of
it, or something equally unfortunate, and so he was
christened Want of Resolution, and he does the
collecting work very well, considering all things."</p>

<p>No doubt the Zankiwank knew what he was
talking about, but as the children did not&mdash;what
did it signify? Therefore they asked no more
questions, but went along the street marvelling at
all they saw. The next shop at which they
stopped was kept by</p>

<p class="center1">Jorumgander the Younger,<br />
Dealer in Magic and Mystery.</p>

<p>"Jorumgander the Younger is not of much use
now," said the Zankiwank sorrowfully. "He chiefly
aims at making a mystery of everything, but so
many people not engaged in trade make a mystery
of nothing every day, that he is sadly handicapped.
And most sensible people hate a mystery of any
kind, unless it belongs to themselves, so that he
finds customers very shy. Once upon a time he
would get hold of a simple story and turn it into
such a gigantic mystery that all the world would
be mystified. But those happy days are gone,
and he thinks of turning his business into a
company to sell Original Ideas, when he knows
where to find them."</p>

<p>"I don't see what good can come of making
a mystery of anything&mdash;especially if anything is
true," sagaciously remarked Maude.</p>

<p>"But <i>anything</i> is not true. Nor is <i>anything</i>
untrue. There is the difficulty. If anything were
true, nothing would be untrue, and then where
should we be?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere," said Willie without thinking.</p>

<p>"Exactly. That is just where we are now,
and a very nice place it is. There is one thing,
however, that Jorumgander the Younger&mdash;there
he is with the pink eye-brows and green nose.
Don't say anything about his personal appearance.
What I was going to say he will say
instead. It is a habit we have occasionally.
He is my grandfather, you know."</p>

<p>"Your grandfather! What! that young man?
Why, he is not more than twenty-two and three
quarters, I'm sure," replied Maude.</p>

<p>"You are right. He <i>is</i> twenty-two and three
quarters. You don't quite understand our relationships.
The boy, as you have no doubt heard,
is father to the man. Very well. I am the man.
When he was a boy on my aunt's side he was
father to me. That's plain enough. He has
grown older since then, though he is little more
than a boy in discretion still, therefore he is my
grandfather."</p>

</div>

<p>"How very absurdly you do talk, Mr Zankiwank,"
laughed Willie; "but here is your
grandfather," and at that moment Jorumgander
the Younger left his shop and approached
them with a case of pens which he offered for
sale.</p>

<p>"Try my Magic Pens. They are the best in
the market, because there are no others. There
is no demand for
them, and few folk
will have them for
a gift. Therefore I
can highly recommend
them."</p>

<p>"How can you recommend
your pens,
when you declare
that nobody will buy them?"
demanded Willie.</p>

<p>"Because they are a
novelty. They are Magic
Pens, you know, and of
course as nobody possesses
any, they must be rare.
That is logic, I think."</p>

<p>"Buy one," said the Zankiwank,
"he has not had
any supper yet."</p>

<p>"In what way are they Magic Pens?" enquired
Maude.</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought I should find a customer between
Michaelmas and May Day," cried Jorumgander
the Younger, quite cheerfully. "The beauty
of these pens is that they never tell a story."</p>

<p>"But suppose you want to write a story?"</p>

<p>"That is a different thing. If you have the
ability to write a story you won't want a Magic
Pen. These pens are only for every-day use. For
example: if you want to write to your charwoman
to tell her you have got the toothache, and you
haven't got the toothache, the Magic Pen refuses
to lend itself to telling a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Crammer," suggested Willie.</p>

<p>"Crammer. Thank you. I don't know what
it means, but crammer is the correct word. The
Magic Pen will simplify the truth whether you
wish to tell it or not."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," whispered Maude.</p>

<p>"Let me try to explain," said Jorumgander the
Younger politely. "The Magic Pen will only
write exactly what you think&mdash;what is in your
mind, what you ought to say, whether you wish to
or not."</p>

<p>"A very useful article, I am sure," said the
Zankiwank. "I gave six dozen away last Christmas,
but nobody used them after a few days, and
I can't think why."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Jorumgander the Younger, "and
I have had all my stock returned on my hands.
The first day I opened my shop I sold more than
I can remember. And the next morning all the
purchasers came and wanted their money back.
They said if they wanted to tell the truth, they
knew how to do it, and did not want to be taught
by an evil-disposed nib. But I am afraid they
were not speaking the truth then, at any rate.
Here, let me make you a present of one a-piece,
and you can write and tell me all about yourselves
when you go home. Meanwhile, as the streets are
crowded, and our policeman is not looking, let us
sing a quiet song to celebrate the event."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We sing of the Magic Pen<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That never tells a story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the hands of men<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Which we think should please all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What the chorus had to do with the song nobody
knew, but they all sang it&mdash;everybody in the
street, and all the customers in the shops as well,
and even the policeman sang the last line.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Again everybody danced and sang till the
policeman told them to "move on," when Jorumgander
the Younger put up his shutters and went
away.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"A most original man," exclaimed the Zankiwank;
"he ought to have been a postman!"</p>

<p>"A postman!&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Because he was always such a capital boy with
his letters. He knew his alphabet long before he
could spell, and now he knows every letter you can
think of."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything very original in that,"
said Willie. "There are only twenty-six letters
in the English language that he can know!"</p>

<p>"Only twenty-six letters! Dear me, why
millions of people are writing fresh letters every
day, and he knows them all directly he sees them!
I hope you will go to school some day and learn
differently from that! Only twenty-six letters,"
repeated the Zankiwank in wonderment, "only
twenty-six letters." Then he cried suddenly,
"How convenient it would be if everybody was
his own Dictionary!"</p>

<p>"That is impossible. One cannot be a book."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, nothing simpler. Let everybody
choose his own words and give his own meaning
to them!"</p>

<p>"What use would that be?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>"None whatever, because if you always had
your own meaning you would not want anybody
else to be meaning anything! What a lot of
trouble that would save! I'll ask the Jackarandajam
to make one for me&mdash;why, here he is!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Page138" id="Page138"></a>
<img src="images/z151.jpg" width="640" height="335" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The children recognised the Jackarandajam
immediately and shook hands with him.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you all. I have just been
suffering from a most severe attack of Inspiration."</p>

<p>"How very inexplicable&mdash;I beg your pardon,"
moaned the Zankiwank. "It is a little difficult,
but it is, I believe, a strictly proper word&mdash;though
I do not pretend to know its meaning."</p>

<p>The Jackarandajam accepted the apology by
gracefully bowing, though neither felt quite at ease.</p>

<p>"What is the use of saying things you don't
mean?" asked Maude.</p>

<p>"None at all, that is the best of it, because we
are always doing something without any reason."</p>

<p>To attempt to argue with the Zankiwank Maude
knew was futile, so she merely enquired how the
Jackarandajam felt after his attack of Inspiration,
and what he took for it.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the simple rejoinder. "It comes
and it goes, and there you are&mdash;at least most of
the time."</p>

<p>"What is Inspiration?" said Willie.</p>

<p>The Zankiwank and the Jackarandajam both
shook their heads in a solemn manner, and looked
as wise as the Sphinx. Then the former answered
slowly and deliberately&mdash;</p>

<p>"Inspiration is the sort of thing that comes
when you do not fish for it."</p>

<p>"But," said Willie, who did not quite see the
force of the explanation, "you can't fish for a great
many things and of course nothing comes. How
do you manage then?"</p>

<p>This was a decided poser, beating them at their
own game, so the Zankiwank sent another telegram,
presumably to the Bletherwitch, and the
Jackarandajam made a fresh cigarette, which he
carefully refrained from smoking. Then he turned
to the two children and said mournfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you seen my new invention? Ah! it
was the result of my recent attack of Inspiration.
Come with me and I will show you." Thereupon
he led the way to a large square, with a nice garden
in the centre, where all the houses had bills outside
to inform the passers by that these</p>

<p class="center1">Desirable Revolving Residences<br />
were to be<br />
LET or SOLD.</p>

<p>"All my property. I had the houses built
myself from my own plans. Come inside the
first."</p>

<p>So they followed the Jackarandajam and
entered the first house.</p>

<p>"The great advantage of these houses," he
declared, "is that you can turn them round to
meet the sun at will. They are constructed on
a new principle, being fixed on a pivot. You
see I turn this handle by the hall door, and
Hey Presto! we are looking into the back
garden, while the kitchen is round at the front!"</p>

<p>And such was the fact! The house would
move any way one wished simply by turning
the electric handle.</p>

<p>"It is so convenient, you see, if you don't
want to be at home to any visitor. When you
see anyone coming up the garden path, you
move the crank and away you go, and your
visitor, to his well-bred consternation, finds himself
gazing in at the kitchen window. And then
he naturally departs with many misgivings as
to the state of his health. Especially if the
cook is taken by surprise. You should never
take a cook by surprise. It always spoils her
photograph."</p>

<p>"Oh dear! Oh dear!" cried Maude, "why
will you say such contradictory things! I don't
see the sense of having such a house at all. It
would upset things so."</p>

<p>"Besides," chimed in Willie, "you would never
have any aspect or prospect."</p>

<p>"Are they both good to eat?" said the Jackarandajam,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Of course not. I meant that your house
would first be facing the East, and then South,
and then West, and then North, and what would
be the use of that?"</p>

<p>"No use whatever. That's why we do it. Oh,
but do not laugh. We are not quite devoid of
reason, because we are all mad!"</p>

<p>"Are you really mad?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the gay response, "we don't mind
it a bit. We are all as crooked as a teetotaler's
corkscrew! I am glad you do not like the
Revolving Houses, because I am going to sell
them to the Clerk of the Weather and his eight
new assistants!"</p>

<p>"I did not know the Clerk of the Weather
required any assistance," exclaimed Willie, though
personally he did not know the Clerk of the
Weather.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he must have assistants. He does
things so badly, and with eight more he will, if
he is careful, do them worse."</p>

<p>Here was another one of those contradictions
that the children could not understand. I hope
you can't, because I don't myself, generally. The
Jackarandajam went on reflectively:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is bound to happen. The Clerk of the
Weather has only one assistant now, and it
takes the two of them to do a Prog&mdash;Prog&mdash;don't
interrupt me&mdash;a Prog&mdash;Prognostication!&mdash;phew,
what a beautiful word!&mdash;Prognostication ten
minutes now. Therefore it stands to reason, as
the Sun Dial remarked, that nine could do it in
much less time!"</p>

<p>"You will excuse me," halloed the Zankiwank
down the next door dining-room chimney, "I
beg to differ from you. That is to say on the
contrary. For instance:&mdash;If it takes two people
ten minutes to do a prog&mdash;you must fill in the
rest yourself&mdash;prog&mdash;of course, as there are so
many more to do the same thing, it must take
them forty-five minutes."</p>

<p>"What a brain," exclaimed the Jackarandajam,
ecstatically; "he ought to have been born a Calculating
Machine. He beats Euclid and that
fellow named Smith on all points. I never
thought of it in the light of multiplying the
addition."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page145" id="Page145"></a>
<img src="images/z158.jpg" width="600" height="750" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"More nonsense," observed Willie to Maude.
"What does it all mean?" They looked out of
window and saw the Zankiwank arguing with
the Clerk of the Weather and the Weather
Cock on top of the vane of a large building
outside. Every minute they expected to see
them tumble down, but they did not, so to cheer
them up the Jackarandajam stood on his head
and sang them this comic song:&mdash;</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Clerk of the Weather.</span></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Clerk of the Weather went out to walk<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All down Victoria Street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of late his ways had caused much talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And chatter indiscreet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he donned a suit of mingled sleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a dash of falling snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rainy tie, and a streaky skye<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which barked where'er he'd go.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Then, to the surprise of Willie and Maude, the
Jackarandajam began to dance wildly, while the
Weather Cock sang as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">O cock-a-doodle-doo!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The weather will be fine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">If it does not sleet or hail or snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And if it does not big guns blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the sun looks out to shine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Jackarandajam stood on his head again
and sang the second verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wrapt up in his thoughts he went along,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His manner sad and crossed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a windy strain he hummed a song,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of thunderbolts and frost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strode with a Barometrical stride,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With forecasts on his brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he tripped up Short upon a slide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which made him vow a vow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">The Weather Cock at once sang the chorus and
the Jackarandajam danced as before.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">O Cock-a-doodle-doo!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The weather will be fine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">If there is no fog, or drenching rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And thunder does not boom again,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the sun looks out to shine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now came the third and last verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His prophesies got all mixed and mulled,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Moon began to blink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his faculties were dulled<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When he saw the Dog Star wink!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up on the steeple tall and black<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Weather Cock he crew!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He crew and he crowed till he fell in the road,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O cock-a-doodle-doo!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And sure enough the Weather Cock did tumble
into the road, and the Clerk of the Weather and
the Zankiwank tumbled helter skelter after him.
Immediately they got up again and rushed
through the window, and catching hold of the
children, they whirled them round and round,
singing the final chorus all together:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">O cock-a-doodle-doo!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The weather will be fine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">If lightning does not flash on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Nor gloomy be the azure sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the sun peeps out to shine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">After which they all disappeared except the
Zankiwank, and once again they found themselves
in the street.</p>

<p>"They were both wrong," muttered the Zankiwank
to himself, "and yet one was right."</p>

<p>"How could they both be wrong then? One
was right? Very well. Then only one was
wrong," corrected Maude.</p>

<p>"No, they were both wrong&mdash;because I was
the right one after all. Besides, you can't always
prove a negative, can you?"</p>

<p>"How tiresome of you! You only mentioned
two and now say three. I do not believe you
know what you do mean."</p>

<p>"Not often, sometimes, by accident, you know&mdash;only
do not tell anybody else."</p>

<p>"You are certainly very extraordinary persons&mdash;that
is all I can say," said Willie. "You do
not do anything quite rationally or naturally."</p>

<p>"Naturally. Why should we? We are the
great Middle Classes&mdash;neither alive nor dead.
Betwixt and between. Half and half, you know,
for now we are in the Spirit World only known
to poets and children. But do come along, or
the bicycles will start without us, and we have
an appointment to keep."</p>

<p>Now, how could one even try to tell such an
eccentric creature as the Zankiwank that he was
all wrong and talking fables and fibs and tarra-diddles?
Neither of them attempted to correct
these erroneous ideas, but wondering where they
were going next, Maude and Willie mounted the
bicycles that came as if by magic, and rode off
at a terrific rate, though they had never ridden
a machine before.</p>

<p>They were almost out of breath when the
Zankiwank called out "stop," and away went
the bicycles, and they found themselves standing
in front of an immense edifice with a sign-board
swinging from the gambrel roof, on which was
painted in large golden letters&mdash;</p>


<p class="center1">Time was meant for Slaves.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 516px;">
<a name="Page151" id="Page151"></a>
<img src="images/z164.jpg" width="516" height="800" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>There was no opportunity to ascertain what the
sign meant, for all at once there darted out of
the shop Mr Swinglebinks with whom they
had travelled from Charing Cross.</p>

<p>"Don't waste your time like that! Make haste,
let me have five minutes. I am in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Have you got five minutes to spare?" asked
the Zankiwank of Maude.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she replied. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Let me have them at once then. A gentleman
left twenty-five minutes behind him yesterday and
I want to make up half-an-hour for a regular
customer!" screamed Mr Swinglebinks to the
bewildered children.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;O what do you mean? I have got
five minutes to spare and I'll devote them to you if
you like, but I <i>can't</i> give them to you as though
they were a piece of toffee," answered Maude with
much perplexity, while Willie stood awe-struck, not
comprehending Mr Swinglebinks in the least.</p>

<p>"Time is a tough customer, you know. He is
here, he is there, he is gone! He is, he was, he
will be. Yet you cannot trap Time, for he is
like a sunbeam," muttered the Zankiwank as
though he never was short of Time.</p>

<p>"There, that five minutes is gone&mdash;wasted,
passed into the vast vacuum of eternity! With my
friend Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon I can tell
you all about time!  'Time travels in divers paces
with divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
withal, and who he stands still withal!' Oh, I
know Father Time and all his tricks. I have
counted the Sands of Time. I supply him with
his Hour Glass. Don't you apprehend me?"</p>

<p>They certainly did not. Mr Swinglebinks was
more mystifying than all the other persons they had
encountered put together. So they made no reply.</p>

<p>"I am collecting Time. Time, so my copy
books told me, was meant for Slaves. I always
felt sorry for the Slaves. They have no Time,
you know, because it is meant for them. Lots
of things are meant for you, only you won't get
them. Britons never will be Slaves, so they'll
never want for Time. However, as Time was
meant for Slaves, I mean to let them have as
much as I can. So every spare minute or two
I can get, I of course send them over to them."</p>

<p>"It is ridiculous. You cannot measure time
and cut off a bit like that," ventured Willie.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you can. A client of mine was laid
up the other day&mdash;in fact he was in bed for a
fortnight, so, as he had no use for the time he
had on hand before him, he just went to sleep
and sent ten days round to me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Zankiwank, what is this gentleman
saying?" said Maude.</p>

<p>"It's all perfectly true," answered the Zankiwank.
"You often hear of somebody who has
half an hour to spare, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Very good. Sometimes you will hear, too, of
somebody who has lost ten minutes."</p>

<p>"I see," said Willie.</p>

<p>"And somebody else will tell you they do not
know what to do with their Time?"</p>

<p>"Go on," cried both children, more puzzled than
ever.</p>

<p>"Well, instead of letting all the Time be wasted,
Mr Swinglebinks has opened his exchange to
receive all the spare time he can, and this he
distributes amongst those who want an hour or a
day or a week. But they have to pay for it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pay for it?"</p>

<p>"Time is money," called out Mr Swinglebinks.</p>

<p>"There you are. If Time is money you can
exchange Time for money and money for Time.
Is not that feasible?"</p>

<p>Did anybody ever hear of such queer notions?
Maude and Willie were quite tired through trying
to think the matter out.</p>

<p>Time was meant for slaves.&mdash;Time is money.&mdash;Time
and Tide wait for no man.&mdash;Take Time
when Time is.&mdash;Take Time by the forelock.&mdash;Procrastination
is the thief of Time.&mdash;Killing Time
is no murder.&mdash;Saving Time is no crime. As
quick as thought Mr Swinglebinks exhibited these
statements on his swinging sign, one after the other,
and then he came to them once again.</p>

<p>"Are you convinced now? Let me have a
quarter of an hour to send to the poor slaves.
Time was meant for them, you know, and
you are using their property without acknowledgment!"</p>

<p>The Zankiwank looked on as wise as an owl,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Dear me, how you are wasting your time
sitting there doing nothing!" said Mr Swinglebinks
distractedly. "Time is money&mdash;Time is money.
Give me some of the Time you are losing."</p>

<p>"Let us go, Willie," said Maude. "Do not
waste any more Time. We have no Time to lose,
let alone time to spare! Shall we kill Time?"</p>

<p>She had barely finished speaking when Mr
Swinglebinks and his Time Exchange disappeared,
and they were alone with the Zankiwank. But
not for long, for almost immediately a troop of
school children came bounding home from school,
but children with the oddest heads and faces ever
seen. They were all carrying miniature bellows
in their hands, which they were working up and
down with great energy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 896px;">
<a name="Page158" id="Page158"></a>
<div class="figleft1" style="width: 448px;">

</div>
<div class="figright1" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/z172.jpg" width="448" height="224" alt="" title="" />
</div>
</div>



<p>"Oh, Mr Zankiwank, what is the matter with
those children in short frocks and knickerbockers?
Look at their heads!"</p>

<p>The Zankiwank gazed, but expressed no surprise,
and yet the children, if they were children,
certainly looked very queer, for the boys had got
aged, care-worn faces with moustaches and whiskers,
while the little girls, in frocks just reaching
to their knees, had women's faces, with their hair
done up in plaits and chignons and Grecian
knot fashion, with elderly bonnets perched on the
top.</p>

<p>"That," said the Zankiwank, "is the force of habit."</p>

<p>"What habit, please? It does not suit them,"
said Maude.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. Good habits become
second nature."</p>

<p>"And what do bad habits become?" queried
Willie.</p>

<p>"Bad habits," answered the Zankiwank severely,
"become no one."</p>

<p>"And these must be bad habits," exclaimed
Willie, pointing to the children, "for they do not
become them."</p>

<p>"I thought their clothes fitted them very well."</p>

<p>"We don't mean their clothes," cried Maude.
"We mean their general appearance."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are referring to the unnatural history
aspect of the case. You mean their heads, of
course. They do <i>not</i> fit properly. I have noticed
it myself. It comes of expecting too much, and
overdoing it; it is all the result of what so many
people are fond of doing&mdash;putting old heads on
young shoulders."</p>

<p>So the mystery was out. The old heads were
unmistakably on young shoulders. And how very
absurd the children looked! Not a bit like happy
girls and boys, as they would have been had they
possessed their own heads instead of over-grown
and over-developed minds and brains. Old heads
never do look well on young shoulders, and it is
very foolish of people to think they do. It makes
them children of a larger growth before their time,
and is just as bad as having young heads on old
shoulders. The moral of which is, that you should
never be older than you are nor younger than you
are not.</p>

<p>"But what are they doing with those bellows?"
enquired Willie and Maude together.</p>

<p>"Raising the wind," promptly responded the
Zankiwank, "or trying to. When folk grow old
before their time you will generally find that it
is owing to the bother they had in raising the wind
to keep the pot boiling."</p>

<p>"But you don't keep the pot boiling with wind,"
they protested.</p>

<p>"Oh yes you do, in Topsy-Turvey Land, though
personally I believe it to be most unright!"</p>

<p>"Un&mdash;what?" exclaimed Maude.</p>

<p>"Unright. When a thing is wrong it must be
unright. Just the same as when a thing is right it
is unwrong."</p>

<p>While the Zankiwank was giving this very lucid
explanation the "Old heads on young shoulders"
children went sedately and mournfully away, just
as a complete train of newspaper carts dashed up
to a large establishment with these words printed
outside&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">Atnagagdlintit Ralinginginarmik<br />
Lusaruminassumik.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, what awful looking words! It
surely must be Welsh?" The two children put
the question to the Zankiwank.</p>

<p>"No, that is not Welsh. That is the way the
Esquimaux of Greenland speak. It is the name
of their paper, and means something to read,
interesting news of all sorts. But in this newspaper
they never print any news of any sort.
They supply the paper to the Topsy-Turveyites
every morning quite blank, so that you can provide
yourself with your own news. Being perfectly
blank, the editors succeed in pleasing all their
subscribers."</p>

<p>"Well, I do not see any advantage in that."</p>

<p>"There you go again!" cried the Zankiwank.
"You always want something with an advantage.
What's the use of an advantage, I should like to
know? You can only lose it. You cannot give
it away. Do try to be original. But listen,
Nobody's coming."</p>

<p>They both looked round wondering what the
Zankiwank meant by his strange perversities, but
could not see anyone.</p>

<p>"We can see Nobody," they said.</p>

<p>"Of course. Here he is!"</p>

<p>Well! Was it a shadow? Something was there
without a doubt, and certainly without a body. It
was a sort of skeleton, or a ghost, or perhaps a
Mahatma! But it was not a Mahatma&mdash;it was
in fact Nobody, of whom you have of course
heard.</p>

<a name="Page163" id="Page163"></a>
<img src="images/z176.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"At last, at last!" screamed the delighted
Zankiwank, "with your eyes wide open and your
faculties unimpaired you see <span class="smcap">Nobody</span>! And what
a memory Nobody has!"</p>

<p>"How can Nobody have a memory? Besides,
we can see Nobody!" said Maude, more perplexed
than she had ever been.</p>

<p>"Exactly, Nobody has a charming memory.
Memory, as you know, is the sense you forget
with it!"</p>

<p>"Memory," corrected Willie, "is the sense, if it
is a sense, or impression you remember with."</p>

<p>"Oh, what dreadful Grammar! Remember
with! How can you finish a sentence with a
preposition? What do you remember with it?"
demanded the Zankiwank reprovingly.</p>

<p>"Anything&mdash;everything you want to," replied
Willie.</p>

<p>"Another preposition! Ah, if we could only
remember as easily as we forget!"</p>

<p>"You are wandering from the subject," suggested
Maude. "The subject is Nobody, and you have
told us nothing about it."</p>

<p>"H'm," said the Zankiwank. "You have confessed
that you can see Nobody, therefore I will
request him to sing you a topical song. Now keep
your attention earnestly directed towards Nobody
and listen."</p>

<p>Knowing from past experience that the Zankiwank
would have his own way, Maude and Willie,
having no one else to think about, thought of Nobody,
and to their amazement they heard these
words sung as from a long way off, in a very
hollow tone of voice:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Just as the song was finished, the Zankiwank
cried out in alarm&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's Somebody coming."</p>

<p>And Nobody disappeared at once, for the children
saw Nobody go!</p>

<p>"And now," said the Zankiwank, "we may expect
the Griffin from Temple Bar and the Ph&#339;nix from
Arabia."</p>

<p>A dark shadow enveloped the square in which
they were standing; then there was a weird
perfume of damp fireworks and saltpetre, and
before any one could say Guy Fawkes, the
Ph&#339;nix rose from his own funeral pyre of faded
frankincense, mildewed myrrh, and similar
luxuries, and flapped his wings vigorously, just
as the Griffin jumped off his pedestal, which he
had brought with him, and piped out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here we are again!"</p>

<p>"Once in a thousand years," responded the
Ph&#339;nix somewhat hoarsely, for he had nearly
swallowed some of his own ashes.</p>

<p>The Griffin, as everybody knows, is shaped like
an eagle from its legs to the shoulder and the head,
while the rest of his body is like that of a lion.
The Ph&#339;nix is also very much like an intelligent
eagle, with gold and crimson plumage and an
exceptionally waggish tail. It has the advantage
of fifty orifices in his bill, through which he
occasionally sings melodious songs to oblige the
company. As he never appears to anyone more
than once in five hundred years, sometimes, when
he has the toothache for instance, only once in a
thousand years&mdash;which is why he is called a rara
avis&mdash;if you ever meet him at any time take
particular notice of him. And if you can draw,
if it is only the long bow, make a sketch of him.
He lives chiefly on poets&mdash;which is why so many
refer to him. He has been a good friend to the
poets of all ages, as your cousin William will
explain. If you have not got a cousin William,
ask some one who has.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Page170" id="Page170"></a>
<img src="images/z183.jpg" width="640" height="376" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Not having the gift of speech, neither of them
spoke, but they could sing, and this is what they
intended to say, duet-wise:&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am a sacred bird, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I am a Griffin bold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Arabia the blest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We feather our own nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To keep us from the cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we're so very fabulous&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, that's the Griffin straight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We rise up from the flames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To play old classic games,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like a Ph&#339;nix up-to-date!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Then they spread out their wings and executed
the most diverting feather dance ever seen out
of a pantomime.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am a watchful bird, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I am a Ph&#339;nix smart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Shakespeare unto Jones&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Welsh one&mdash;who intones,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We have played a striking part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we're so very mystical,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Both off-springs of the brain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mongoose is our <i>pere</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Nightmare is our <i>mere</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And we thrive on Fiction Plain!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">They repeated their dance and then knocked at
the door of the nearest house and begged pantomimically
for money, but as it was washing day
they were refused. So they went into the cook shop
and had some Irish Stew, which did not agree
with them. Consequently they sprang into the
hash that was simmering on the fire, and were
seen no more. Whereupon the Zankiwank looked
gooseberrily out of his eyes and murmured as if
nothing out of the way or in the way had happened,
or the Ph&#339;nix or the Griffin had existed&mdash;"The
Bletherwitch will send me a telegram to say that
she will be ready for the ceremony in half-an-hour."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page173" id="Page173"></a>
<img src="images/z186.jpg" width="600" height="678" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"But where is the Bletherwitch, and how do you
know?" asked Maude, somewhat incredulously.</p>

<p>"She is being arrayed for the marriage celebration.
At present she is in Spain gathering
Spanish onions."</p>

<p>"But Spanish onions don't come from Spain!"</p>

<p>"You are right. It is pickled walnuts she is
gathering from the Boot Tree in the scullery.
However, that is of no consequence. Let us be
joyful as befits the occasion. Who has got any
crackers?"</p>

<p>Before any reply could be given a voice in the
air screamed out:&mdash;"Beware of the Nargalnannacus!"
At which the Zankiwank trembled and
the whole place seemed to rock to and fro.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the Nargalnannacus?"</p>

<p>"It's a noun!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"A noun is the name of a person, place or
thing, I believe?"</p>

<p>"It was yesterday."</p>

<p>"It is to-day. And that is what the Nargalnannacus
is. He, She, or It is a person, place or
thing, and it travels about, and that is all I
know of it. Nobody has ever seen a Nargalnannacus,
and nobody ever will, not a real,
proper, authen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Authenticated," assisted Maude.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;authenticated one. Directly they
do they turn yellow and green, and are seen no
more."</p>

<p>"What are we to do then?" anxiously enquired
Willie.</p>

<p>"The best that offers. We have been expecting
an outbreak for a long time, and here comes
the Court Physician, Dr Pampleton, to happily
confirm my worst suspicions!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Page177" id="Page177"></a>
<img src="images/z190.jpg" width="400" height="640" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The children thought it extremely odd that
having one's worst suspicions confirmed should
make any person happy. But they were accustomed
to the Zankiwank's curious modes of
speech and lack of logic, so that they wisely
held their tongues in silence. The newcomer
was of very remarkable appearance. He was
tall and slim like the Zankiwank, but instead
of having the ordinary shaped head and face, he
carried on his shoulders a sheep's head, and in
his veins (so they heard afterwards) ran sheep's
blood. At one period of his existence he had
been well-known for his wool-gathering propensities,
and he was now strongly recommended as
being able to commit more mistakes and blunders
in half-an-hour than a school boy could in a
whole school term. He had one great virtue,
however, and that was that he would always
instantly apologise for any error he might make.</p>



<p>He never travelled without his medicine chest,
which he carried by straps over his shoulders,
and was prepared to give anybody a dose of
physic without the slightest provocation at
double charges.</p>

<p>"There is danger ahead," he whispered to the
Zankiwank, "and a lot of visitors are coming to
fight to the bitter end."</p>

<p>"Tell me their names," cried the Zankiwank
excitedly. Whereupon, Dr Pampleton recited
them as follows, the Zankiwank groaning as
each cognomen was uttered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Wollypog" (<i>groan</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Fustilug" (<i>groan</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What's-His-Name" (<i>groan</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thing'um-a-Bob" (<i>groan</i>)<br /></span>
<span class="i6">and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Woogabblewabble Bogglewoggle and all his Court."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last was too much for the Zankiwank,
for he immediately climbed to the top of the
tallest steeple in the town, saying with much
discretion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will see that all is fair. I will be the judge."</p>

<p>Maude had only just got time to eat some of the
Fern Seeds she had saved from what Robin Goodfellow
had given her, and to give some to Willie,
when a rushing as of many waters and a roaring
as of the bursting of several gasometers were heard,
and a noise of some two or three hundred tramping
soldiers smote upon their ears, and they knew that
something dreadful was going to happen. As the
Bogglewoggle and the Wollypog and all the
others came upon the scene, both the children
recognised them, from what they had once read in
a fairy book, as being the monsters of the Secret
Cavern.</p>

<p>It was not going to be a battle, as they could
see&mdash;it was only to be a quiet fight between the
important folk of the Secret Cavern and Topsy
Turvey Land. The Jorumgander was there, and
so was the Jackarandajam and Mr Swinglebinks
and all the others they had been introduced to.
The Bogglewoggle was particularly noisy in calling
out for the Zankiwank, but as he was engaged
to be married, of course he could not risk his life
just for the mere whim of a dragon, who
was setting everything alight with his torch-like
tail.</p>

<p>And then they all commenced to fight&mdash;cutting,
slashing and crashing each other with double-edged
swords, while the inhabitants applauded and the
bands played the "Conquering Hero," although
there was not any creature who conquered, that
one could distinguish. It was a terrible sight.
They never ceased for a minute, but went on
cutting each other to pieces until at last they all
lay dead upon the ground. No one was left alive
to tell the awful news but the Zankiwank and
Dr Pampleton. And what was most remarkable
about the fight was that it was all done out of
pure friendship&mdash;but friendship does not seem to
be much good when all your friends are scattered
about, as these were. Heads and arms and legs
everywhere, and there certainly did not appear to
be much hope of their ever being able to do any
more damage.</p>

<p>The Zankiwank crept cautiously down from his
pinnacle and joined Dr Pampleton.</p>

<p>"Our friends are very much cut up," said Dr
Pampleton.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" the Zankiwank enquired.</p>

<p>"Done? Why, with my special elixir I shall
bring them all to life again," said the Court
Physician promptly.</p>

<p>"Will you? Can you?"</p>

<p>"Of course. You get all the bodies and lay
them in a line. I'll gather up the heads and stick
'em on with elastic glue. Then you find the arms
and legs and we will soon have them ready for
another bout."</p>

<p>So the Zankiwank sent the rest of the populace,
that had been looking on, indoors to get their tea,
while he set to work and did as that absurd old
Doctor instructed him.</p>



<p>Willie and Maude could scarcely keep their eyes
open, but they were so interested in the proceedings
that they managed to see that the Court
Physician with his usual foresight was sticking the
heads on the wrong bodies, and the arms and legs
he put on just as they were handed to him, left on
the right, and right on the left, and no one individual
got his own proper limbs fastened to him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Page183" id="Page183"></a>
<img src="images/z196.jpg" width="600" height="734" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>It was the funniest thing they had ever seen&mdash;better
than any pantomime, for sure enough they
all came to life again, and naturally, seeing
another person's arms and legs on their bodies,
they imagined themselves to be somebody else
entirely. And then ensued the most deafening
confusion conceivable, each one accusing the
other of having robbed him in his sleep, for
they were under the impression that they had
been to bed in a strange place&mdash;and so they
had.</p>

<p>It was the grandest transformation scene ever
witnessed. The Zankiwank was in deep distress,
but Dr Pampleton was in high glee and laughed
immoderately.</p>

<p>"Such a funny mistake to make!" he crowed
hysterically to the hopping, hobbling, jumping
crowd of monsters and dwarfs, who were glaring
at each other in a very savage manner.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;my fault&mdash;all lie down
again, and I will cut you up once more and put
you together correctly this time," said the Court
Physician pleasantly.</p>

<p>"So!" they all bellowed in chorus, "it is you
who have done all this mischief. Come on! We
will soon rectify your blunder," and with a swish
and a swirl they made one simultaneous movement
towards the unfortunate Pampleton, and once again
Pandemonium was let loose, when high above the
din the voice of the Zankiwank was heard calling
upon them to have patience and not to disturb the
harmony, as the Bletherwitch had arrived at last.
Meanwhile everybody rushed madly down the
street after the Court Physician.</p>

<p>But the children could see nothing now. Everything
was growing dim and dimmer, and the scene
was fading, fading away into a blue light. And
the last they heard was the Zankiwank speaking
tenderly to the Bletherwitch, whom they were not
destined to see after all, and saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my sweet Blethery, Blethery Bletherwitch!
What a Bletherwitching little thing you are!"</p>

<p>Then there was a rumbling and a tumbling, and
something stopped suddenly. A light was flashed
before their eyes, and hey presto! there was John
opening the carriage door for them to get out, and
wonder of wonders, there were their dear mother
and father standing in the hall of their own home
waiting to receive them. And presently they were
being kissed and caressed and petted because, as
Mary their nurse said, they had slept in the carriage
all the way home from the visit to their grandmama.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">

<img src="images/z200.jpg" width="480" height="384" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>This, however, they stoutly denied. They knew
better than that, and told their parents of all their
adventures, which, as they declared, if they were
not true they ought to be, and so they said goodnight
and dreamt their dreams, if they were dreams,
all over again.</p>


<h4>THE END.</h4>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
